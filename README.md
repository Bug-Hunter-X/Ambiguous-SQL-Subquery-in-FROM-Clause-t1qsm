This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving the misuse of subqueries in the FROM clause. The `bug.sql` file contains a query with a correlated subquery that lacks an alias, resulting in ambiguity and syntax errors. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides the corrected query with proper aliasing to resolve the issue.  The error is subtle and often overlooked, especially by less experienced SQL developers. This example serves as a helpful learning tool for understanding and avoiding this type of error.
