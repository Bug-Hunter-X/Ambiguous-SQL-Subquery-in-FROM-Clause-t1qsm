The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to retrieve data, however, it incorrectly uses a correlated subquery without proper aliasing which leads to ambiguity and syntax errors:

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM (SELECT column1 FROM table1 WHERE condition) WHERE condition2;
```

The problem is that the subquery lacks an alias, making it difficult for the database to distinguish between the two `column1` references (one from the outer query and one from the subquery).
