The corrected SQL query includes an alias for the subquery, clearly separating the two `column1` references:

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM (SELECT column1 AS sub_column1 FROM table1 WHERE condition) AS subquery WHERE sub_column1 LIKE condition2;
```

By aliasing the subquery as `subquery` and the `column1` within the subquery as `sub_column1`, the query becomes unambiguous and correctly retrieves data.  Using aliases makes complex queries much more readable and maintainable.
